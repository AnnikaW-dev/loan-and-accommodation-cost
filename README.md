#  MS2 project-loan-and-accommodation-cost

I thougth that an easily accessible calculator should be god to have when you are about to buy a new home. When I started to draw the wire frame for this i got quit big with alot of calculation and my thought was also that you should be able to calculate your tax when you sold one home and bought a new and many more things. What I also whanted to get in was statistics whit some grafs.
I started big in my mind and looked around how i should build this but the time ran away for me and it resulted in this small calculator due to the time and also because things that I thuoght was easy where much more tricky and time consuming that I first thought.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion
The Yoga pause web site is build for everyone that sits infront of the desk for many hours and needs to take a small break and move or relax for a moment. I did this due to that I have seen in my previous job that many got pain in nack, shoulders caused of to many hours infront of the computer. As I am a Yoga teatcher I thought that wolud be good for the health to take a small paus and do yoga or relax with help of meditation.

This is a start up site that the owner want to grow but wanted to start small to let it grow after the visitors feedback.

### User Stories

#### Yoga beginners
Would like to receive step-by-step instructions for beginner yoga.
Would like clear images that showing each position.
Would like easy positions that all can do.

#### Workers
Want to have short sessions due they only can take short pauses.
Want sessions that are suitable for small spaces.
Want alternative seated yoga.
Want to have session that helps to be more calm and relaxed.




## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

I choosed those colurs due to that i like them and I think those colours are calming and soft to look at. The blue colour did I chose due to that i thought it was goo with the other but pops so I used that to all buttons.

I got to change the colour a little due to low contrast L√ÑNK TILL test

![Shows the color scheme that I started from](docs/readme_images/Colors.png)


### Typography

I choose Marck Script due to that is soft and looks nice in the navbar and as a h1 header.
Choose Kavivnar due to that is allso soft but are much easier to read in longer text. So i used it in all other headers and texts.

![Shows the the font styles that I used in YogaPaus](docs/readme_images/font_styles.png)


### Imagery

I to use the carousel on the home page as a gallery with pictures form office yoga from Stockcake instead of having a gallery https://stockcake.com/.
The images for yoga instructions and for the coming up page I used illustrations from dreamtime  https://www.dreamstime.com/
Both sites have free download and are royaltyfree.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Features

YogaPaus is divided in three pages as home, Yoga and coming up. It allso have ha thank you page that is shown when the user have sent a message and a 404 page.

* All pages have: 

  * A navigation bar that are responsive and easy to use on all size of devices. To the left it has a Header and to the rigth there is hamburger icon that symbolize menu on small devices. when you click it the menu opens up with links to Home, Yoga, Contact Us and Coming Up. On bigger devices the link-menu shows in right section of the nav bar.
  This make it easy for user to navigat on the site from all pages. And the hamburger icon is a well known icon for menu so most user will know what it is used for.

  * A footer with social media icons to facebook, Instagram, x and yotube. This icons that are used as links is universally recognisable and make the footer look clean.  

### General features on each page
 
 * Home page 
  
  * It starts with a About text that describes for whom and what it is good for. It allso describe what the site contains and wht you can expect.

  * Carousel with photos of office worker doing yoga in the office.

  * Card section  with four card that describe the four different sessions you can choose from. they also have a button that takes the use directlly to the yoga page and the choise of session the user choosed.

  * Contact section with a form that contains field for name, email address and a textarea for the messages. All fields requiers to be filled before the user are able to send and the email area will only take email addreses. If the user miss somthing they will get antooltip with information of whts missing.

* 404 page
 
 * It will apper if there is some thing wrong with a page so the broser cant open it. It contians a cant find the page message and a Back to home button for easy get back.





I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

* In the future ia would like to:

  *Add login so the members have access to: 

   * Holliday thems for every holliday so yo can chose if you want to use the theme.

   * I would also like to have recorded instuction that so the user can chose to listen or read the instuction and more different sessisions.

### Accessibility

I have had the accessibillity inmind through the procces of building YogaPause by:

* Used sematic HTML

* I have used well known icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these

* I havee ensured to meet the minimum contrst reuirements by test with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) (see the resault in the test section)

* I have chosen the fonts with the readabillity in mind.
